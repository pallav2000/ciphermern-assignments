        <h2>Volleyball</h2>
        <p>
            <pre> 
                Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by 
                a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court 
                under organized rules.
                The complete set of rules is extensive,[2] but play essentially proceeds as follows:
                 a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by 
                 serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then
                  hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line
                   of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court.[3]
                    The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the
                     ball up to 3 times, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.[3] Typically
                     , the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to 
                     direct the ball back over the
                      net in such a way that the serving team is 
                      unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court.

        <h2>CRICKET</h2>
        <p>
            <PRE>
                Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the
                 centre of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising
                  two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball
                   bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent 
                   this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being
                    bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding
                    side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground
                     When ten players have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles.
                      The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee
                       in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record
                        the match's statistical information.
